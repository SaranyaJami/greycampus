Hi,
Today,
I learnt Getting modules and modules as Namespace concepts
I practiced on concepts of:
    strings and operations performed on strings. 
    loops and tried different types of loops.
    creating own classes and objects.
    Defining methods and calling methods.
    lambda. 
    using blocks.
    creating the module and include it in classes and calling methods of the module.
I installed extensions of wsl in  vs code and started practice in vs code.

Thank you.
